## Abstract
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for employee attrition using machine learning. Various algorithms, including RandomForestClassifier and SVM, are employed with hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance. Ensemble methods with CNNs are also explored to improve predictions. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to evaluate the models. The project concludes with recommendations to mitigate attrition based on the findings.

## Introduction
Employee turnover is a significant challenge for organizations, impacting productivity and performance. This project aims to develop predictive models to anticipate employee turnover and identify key influencing factors using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on 1470 employees with 35 features, including demographics, job roles, and satisfaction levels. The target variable is "Attrition".

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Exploratory data analysis provides insights into the distribution of attrition and other variables.

## Data Visualization
Visualizations include:
- Distribution of the target variable "Attrition"
- Conversion of 'Attrition' to numeric values
- One-hot encoding of categorical variables
- Correlation heatmap of numerical variables
- Boxplots and bar plots for numerical and categorical variables, respectively

## Model Selection and Training
Multiple models are evaluated, including:
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Models are trained using a pipeline that includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model fitting. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques are applied to optimize performance.

## Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics
Model performance is assessed using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion matrix

## Hyperparameter Tuning
Grid search is used for hyperparameter tuning, optimizing parameters such as `max_depth`, `min_samples_leaf`, `min_samples_split`, and `n_estimators` for the Random Forest classifier.

## Integration of Convolutional Neural Networks
Exploration of CNN ensembles aims to improve prediction capabilities and provide deeper insights into attrition dynamics.

## Results and Discussion
The performance of different models is analyzed, and factors influencing employee attrition are identified. Recommendations are provided based on the findings to improve employee retention strategies.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting employee attrition. It provides actionable insights for organizations to proactively manage turnover and enhance employee retention.

## Insights and Recommendations
Key factors such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, and years of experience significantly influence attrition. Organizations should focus on these areas to reduce attrition rates. Ensemble methods like Random Forest and SVM exhibit better performance compared to linear models.
